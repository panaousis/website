        <h1 class="entry-title">How I fell in love with writing</h1>
        <p>I was never an avid reader as a kid.</p>
        <p>Though I always liked the idea of having read&mdash;and of having written.</p>
        <p>But, reading, for me, was always a chore and a cognitively strenuous activity. Even fiction.</p>
        <p>I despised that I couldn&rsquo;t read like my friends or compose like other students of my age.</p>
        <p>And, so, I had decided, from early on, that I hated reading and writing.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am just not made for this kind of life,&rdquo; I admitted to myself and swiftly moved on.</p>
        <p>Then, the years passed, and I found myself in a windowless classroom, filled with drowsy students&mdash;a short Indian professor standing in front of the whiteboard, her eyes gleaming with enthusiasm, hope, and eagerness for attention.</p>
        <p>I looked at her and I pondered, how can a human being have so much passion for literature? Why would anyone want to analyze the shallow symbolism of a century-old story? Perhaps the author never intended to implant any meaning in that piece of text, and we are just wasting our time, I pessimistically declared to myself.</p>
        <p>But, as the days passed, and my mornings became a routine of the same passionate professor, professing her love for the written word, something inside me began to change.</p>
        <p>I was starting to gradually immerse myself, inadvertently and without conscious effort, into a world I had long banished from my daily existence&mdash;because I once failed to push against the cognitive barriers on the other side of which a world of wonders awaited.</p>
        <p>One day, after class, as the drowsy crowd was leaving the classroom for their next lesson of the day, the professor motioned me over and asked me whether I wanted to participate in a writing challenge. I had never written a proper paragraph in my life, except for school assignments, I reluctantly admitted to her. How could I be a good fit for that writing challenge?</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s never too late to start writing properly,&rdquo; she responded with a warm smile. &ldquo;Your writing has promise, I see it, and your style is engaging. The deadline is in three weeks. I am sure you will find something to write about.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Okay, professor. I will try my best.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>She handed me a brochure stating the rules of the competition, and I headed to a little canteen outside the campus for breakfast.</p>
        <p>I sat at my usual spot, by the corner window, overlooking the Manhattan skyline, and fiddled with the glossy paper between my thumbs, thinking.</p>
        <p>I had always been enamored by the idea of having written, always in love with the image of the creative writer and the struggles associated with the expression of creativity.</p>
        <p>And, now, it was time to taste that dream, I thought to myself.</p>
        <p>The rumble of the commuter trains made the building tremble as I took out my notebook and started scribbling down sentences that led nowhere, my pen facing the arduous task of starting from the beginning, over and over again.</p>
        <p>To say that my writing was crusty was an understatement.</p>
        <p>But I knew what needed to be done.</p>
        <p>And the days passed, and I kept at it. I had embarked on a quest to master the written word and to nourish my dormant creativity, so that I could put my thoughts to the world. What thoughts? I didn&rsquo;t know at that time. The only thing that I was sure of was that I had something to say despite the lack of its presence.</p>
        <p>I obsessed with grammar; I mastered the comma; I moved on to the em-dash&mdash;I regressed to the fundamentalist attitude of the colons and semi-colons; I weaved clauses with stylistic comma structures that appended conventional grammar rules; I studied story-telling techniques and attempted to emulate other writers. I wrote fiction and non-fiction.</p>
        <p>Writing was starting to become part of my DNA.</p>
        <p>By the end of the semester, I had finished second at the creative writing challenge in the school&rsquo;s literature magazine, making both myself and my professor proud, and I kept writing short pieces for my own pleasure.</p>
        <p>For my <em>own pleasure?&nbsp;</em>Well, at last, I was transformed. I had become a writer that would not stop writing ever since.</p>
        <p>And, all that, thanks to one person, who saw promise where I thought there was none.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we need that soft nudge into the unknown, in order to kickstart a catalytic reaction that will irrevocably change us and show us a path once unimaginable.</p>
        <p>These things happen with the flow of life, seemingly random, by exposure to new settings and openness to new ideas. It&rsquo;s all about saying yes at the right moment and then believing to the fruits of your efforts.</p>
        <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
        <p>Almost a decade later, I am sitting in my desk, with a pen in hand, writing a short story, and thinking of the professor that started it all.</p>
