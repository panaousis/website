        <p>My name is Nikos.</p>

        <p>
          This is my personal website where you will find my writing,
          exploring and connecting the topics of productivity, privacy, health,
          storytelling, and psychology.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not writing a book or working with a client, I write emails
          to you where I share the best lessons I uncover from my readings,
          experimentations, and musings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it’s exploring the niche world of the Zettelkasten method
          (an intricate knowledge-management system based on notecards),
          uncovering hidden gems of wisdom from my readings, or engaging in
          extreme lifestyle modifications,
          <span class="highlight-strong">
            my goal is to gather practical insights and report them back to you.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also my goal—for reasons
          <a href="p/running-from-hell.html">
            described here
          </a>—to help you (and myself) become the most resilient and
          productive version of yourself by equipping you with the tools and
          knowledge to cultivate strength, intellectual rigor, and resistance
          to chronic adversity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim? To tap into our greatest possible states—be it physical or
          mental—and do what we want in life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The vision? To live long and flourish—in freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="yellow-highlight">
            If you have a curious mind and a generalist attitude in life—and,
            most importantly, <i>if you relate with what I have written so far</i>—
            my newsletter might be the perfect fit for you.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          In that case, <span class="underline">I invite you to go ahead and subscribe.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Being on my list means that you will be the first to access my
          upcoming publications, books, free guides, and other content catered
          just for my inner circle.
