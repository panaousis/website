        <p>Live long & flourish</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whether it’s exploring the niche world of the Zettelkasten method (an intricate knowledge-management system based on notecards), uncovering hidden gems of wisdom from my readings, or engaging in extreme lifestyle modifications, my goal is to gather practical insights and report them back to you. Sometimes, I even dabble in fiction.</p>
        <p>On this website, you will find some of my writing. I also run a newsletter. You can subscribe by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://read.panaousis.com/subscribe">clicking here.</a></p>
        <p>It is also my goal—for reasons <a href="p/running-from-hell.html">described here</a>—to help you (and myself) become the most resilient and productive version of yourself by equipping you with the tools and knowledge to cultivate strength, intellectual rigor, and resistance to chronic adversity. The aim? To tap into our greatest possible states—be it physical or mental—and do what we want in life. The vision? To live long and flourish—in freedom.</p>
        <p>If you want to engage with me, you can find me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://x.com/nikpanaousis">Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://panaousis.substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>
