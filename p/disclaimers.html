    <h1>Disclaimers & AI</h1>
    <p>0% of the content on this website was written using AI. The content of this website was written out by hand, using 4x6" index cards and yellow legal pads. It was then typed out by its author, me, and edited on my favorited word processor in Courier Prime. Then, it was formatted and published.</p>
