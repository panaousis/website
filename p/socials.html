    <h1>Social media</h1>
    <p>Hey,</p><p>This is not Twitter, you say? You are right.</p><p>When Twitter stopped feeling like home; that is, a place to connect with like-minded people and explore niches of fascination, I decided to take an extended break from social media. My old Twitter account was archived, deactivated, and eventually deleted.</p><p>But after a few years of inactivity, I decided to come back with the goal of <strong>fighting the algorithm from within.</strong></p><p>I am starting anew, with a clean slate, approaching social media with the following goals in mind:</p><ul><li>Be an agent of unity;</li><li><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf" target="_blank">Short-form algorithmic content is rotting our minds</a>—avoid it at all costs;</li><li>Encourage people to touch grass;</li><li>Share long-form content;</li><li>Ask and encourage genuine, thought-provoking questions; and</li><li>Do not use the "For you" page—this is where discontent resides.</li></ul><p>With that said, here is my new Twitter account: <a href="https://x.com/nikpanaousis" target="_blank">@nikpanaousis</a></p><p>You can also follow me on <a href="https://substack.com/@panaousis" target="_blank">Substack</a> or <a href="mailto:nikos@panaousis.com" target="_blank">email me</a>.</p>
